# Next.js foundations

## The React Framework for the Web. Next.js enables you to create high-quality web applications with the power of React components.

### Built-in optimizations
Automatic Image, Font, and Script Optimizations for improved UX and Core Web Vitals.

The Next.js Image component extends the HTML <img> element with features for automatic image optimization:

- Size Optimization: Automatically serve correctly sized images for each device, using modern image formats like WebP and AVIF.
- Visual Stability: Prevent layout shift automatically when images are loading.
- Faster Page Loads: Images are only loaded when they enter the viewport using native browser lazy loading, with optional blur-up placeholders.
- Asset Flexibility: On-demand image resizing, even for images stored on remote servers

### Dynamic HTML streaming
Instantly stream UI from the server, integrated with the App Router and React Suspense.

### React Server Components
Add components without sending additional client-side JavaScript. Built on the latest React features.

### Data fetching
Make your React component async and await your data. Next.js supports both server and client data fetching.

### CSS support
Style your application with your favorite tools, including support for CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and popular community libraries.

### Client side and Server side rendering
Flexible rendering and caching options, including Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), on a per-page level.

### Server Actions
Run server code by calling a function. Skip the API. Then, easily revalidate cached data and update your UI in one network roundtrip.

### Route handlers
Build API endpoints to securely connect with third-party services for handling auth or listening for webhooks.

### Advanced routing and nested layout
Create routes using the file system, including support for more advanced routing patterns and UI layouts.

### Middleware
Take control of the incoming request. Use code to define routing and access rules for authentication, experimentation, and internationalization.
