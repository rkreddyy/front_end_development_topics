## Definition
Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique that renders a web page on the server rather than in the browser.
When a website's JavaScript is rendered on the website's server, a fully rendered page is sent to the client and the client's JavaScript bundle engages and enables the Single Page Application framework to operate.

## What is Server-Side Rendering?
Server-side rendering is exactly what it sounds like: rendering on the server. When you do this, you'll create an HTML file with all of the content of the site and send it back to the user. 
The user will then get an fully rendered HTML page that contains all of the necessary information for them to see your site without having to wait for any JavaScript or CSS files to load.
This means that users who visit your site will be able to see everything much faster than if they were just looking at blank screen while waiting for JavaScript files to load.

## Benefits of Server-Side Rendering
Some advantages of server-side rendering include:
- Faster load time. A server-side rendered application speeds up page loading when the user suffers from a slow internet connection. Thus it greatly improves the whole user experience.
- Easy indexation by search engines. As the content can be rendered before the page is loaded when rendering server-side, search engines can easily index and crawl it.
- There are fewer issues with social media indexing. Social media crawlers, like search engine bots, have difficulty indexing JavaScript content. Client-side rendering is not supported by Facebook's Open Graph Protocol or Twitter Cards, for example. If social media sharing is an important part of your marketing strategy, server-side rendering may be a better option.
- Better in terms of accessibility. SSR apps are better suited for people who use older devices with less powerful CPUs because the server sends pre-rendered content to the browser. Because assistive technologies such as screen readers cannot always parse client-side JavaScript, server-side rendering is frequently recommended for SPA accessibility. So, server-side rendering helps efficiently load web pages for users with slow Internet connections or outdated devices.

## Potential Drawbacks of Server-Side
Server-side rendering appears to be a simple concept; however, its complexity grows in tandem with the application's complexity.

Here are some disadvantages of server-side rendering:
- Increase in expenses. In order to deploy an SSR application, you'll need to pay for a server or, at the very least, a "serverless" backend, which means higher running costs.
- Although, as server-side rendering is not the default for JavaScript websites, it can be costly and resource-intensive, and the server bears the full burden of rendering content for users and bots.
- May cause slower page rendering. Server-side rendering is ideal for static HTML site generation, but in more complex applications, frequent server requests and full page reloads can result in overall slower page rendering.
- Problems with compatibility. A number of third-party libraries and tools are incompatible with server-side rendering.
- HTML with a larger size. Because of the embedded hydration state, SSR apps have a larger HTML size. This is not an argument against SSR, but rather something to consider as a potential risk if it is implemented incorrectly.


## Sitemaps are XML files that list the URLs of your website and provide additional information, such as the last modification date, the frequency of changes, and the priority of each page. They help search engines discover and index your pages more efficiently and accurately. 
## Robots.txt files are text files that instruct search engines which pages or directories of your website they can or cannot crawl. They help you control the access and visibility of your content and prevent duplicate or low-quality pages from being indexed.
