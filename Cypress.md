# Cypress

Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web.
Cypress can test anything that runs in a browser.
Cypress enables you to write all types of tests:
  - End-to-end tests
  - Integration tests
  - Unit tests

## Cypress features
Cypress comes fully baked, batteries included. Here is a list of things it can do that no other testing framework can:

##### Time Travel 
Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run. Hover over commands in the Command Log to see exactly what happened at each step.
##### Debuggability
Stop guessing why your tests are failing. Debug directly from familiar tools like Developer Tools. Our readable errors and stack traces make debugging lightning fast.
##### Automatic Waiting 
Never add waits or sleeps to your tests. Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on. No more async hell.
##### Spies, Stubs, and Clocks
Verify and control the behavior of functions, server responses, or timers. The same functionality you love from unit testing is right at your fingertips.
##### Network Traffic Control
Easily control, stub, and test edge cases without involving your server. You can stub network traffic however you like.
##### Consistent Results 
Our architecture doesnâ€™t use Selenium or WebDriver. Say hello to fast, consistent and reliable tests that are flake-free.
##### Screenshots and Videos
View screenshots taken automatically on failure, or videos of your entire test suite when run from the CLI.
##### Cross browser Testing
Run tests within Firefox and Chrome-family browsers (including Edge and Electron) locally and optimally in a Continuous Integration pipeline.
