# Express - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js

#### Simple express server setup
This app starts a server and listens on port 3000 for connections. The app responds with “Hello World!” for requests to the root URL (/) or route. For every other path, it will respond with a 404 Not Found.
```
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

#### Route methods
```
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

// GET method route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('GET request to the homepage')
})

// POST method route
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('POST request to the homepage')
})
```
There is a special routing method, app.all(), used to load middleware functions at a path for all HTTP request methods. For example, the following handler is executed for requests to the route “/secret” whether using GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or any other HTTP request method supported in the http module.
```
app.all('/secret', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Accessing the secret section ...')
  next() // pass control to the next handler
})
```
**Route parameters**
```
// Request URL: http://localhost:3000/users/34/books/8989
// req.params: { "userId": "34", "bookId": "8989" }
app.get('/users/:userId/books/:bookId', (req, res) => {
  res.send(req.params)
})
```
**Route handlers**
You can provide multiple callback functions that behave like middleware to handle a request. 
```
const cb0 = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('CB0')
  next()
}

const cb1 = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('CB1')
  next()
}

const cb2 = function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello from C!')
}

app.get('/example/c', [cb0, cb1, cb2])
```
**app.route()**
You can create chainable route handlers for a route path by using app.route(). Because the path is specified at a single location, creating modular routes is helpful, as is reducing redundancy and typos. 
```
app.route('/book')
  .get((req, res) => {
    res.send('Get a random book')
  })
  .post((req, res) => {
    res.send('Add a book')
  })
  .put((req, res) => {
    res.send('Update the book')
  })
```
**express.Router**
Use the express.Router class to create modular, mountable route handlers. A Router instance is a complete middleware and routing system; for this reason, it is often referred to as a “mini-app”.

The following example creates a router as a module, loads a middleware function in it, defines some routes, and mounts the router module on a path in the main app.

Create a router file named birds.js in the app directory, with the following content:
```
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()

// middleware that is specific to this router
router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time: ', Date.now())
  next()
})
// define the home page route
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Birds home page')
})
// define the about route
router.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('About birds')
})

module.exports = router
```
Then, load the router module in the app:
```
const birds = require('./birds')

// ...

app.use('/birds', birds)
```
The app will now be able to handle requests to /birds and /birds/about, as well as call the timeLog middleware function that is specific to the route.
